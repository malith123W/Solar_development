# Phase Identification Feature - NMD Analysis

## üéØ Overview

The **Phase Identification Feature** is a revolutionary addition to the NMD Analysis system that automatically identifies and corrects phase assignments for electrical customers. This feature solves a critical problem in electrical network analysis where single-phase customers may be incorrectly labeled as "Phase A" when they're actually connected to Phase B or C, and three-phase customers may have misaligned phase connections.

## üîß Problem Statement

### Current Issues:
1. **Single-Phase Mislabeling**: All single-phase customers are labeled as "Phase A" in CSV files, but their actual service wire could be connected to Phase A, B, or C
2. **Three-Phase Misalignment**: Three-phase customers may have their phases misaligned with the feeder's actual phase sequence
3. **Manual Verification Required**: Field technicians must manually verify phase connections, which is time-consuming and error-prone
4. **Data Inconsistency**: Incorrect phase labels lead to inaccurate network analysis and planning

### Solution:
The Phase Identification Feature uses **statistical correlation analysis** to automatically identify the correct phase connections by comparing customer voltage patterns with feeder phase voltage profiles.

## üöÄ Key Features

### 1. **Automatic Phase Detection**
- **Single-Phase Customers**: Identifies which feeder phase (A, B, or C) the customer is actually connected to
- **Three-Phase Customers**: Aligns all three customer phases with the correct feeder phases
- **Statistical Analysis**: Uses Pearson correlation and RMSE to determine the best phase match

### 2. **Comprehensive Analysis**
- **Multi-Phase Comparison**: Compares each customer phase against all feeder phases
- **Correlation Scoring**: Calculates correlation coefficients and RMSE for each phase combination
- **Best Match Selection**: Assigns customers to the feeder phase with highest correlation and lowest RMSE

### 3. **Data Correction & Export**
- **Phase Renaming**: Automatically renames customer phase columns to match assigned feeder phases
- **Data Integrity**: Maintains all original data while applying corrections
- **Export Options**: Generates corrected CSV/JSON data with proper phase labels

### 4. **Transparency & Verification**
- **Matching Scores**: Provides correlation and RMSE values for transparency
- **Phase Assignments**: Shows which customer phase maps to which feeder phase
- **Quality Indicators**: Color-coded correlation strength indicators

## üìä Technical Implementation

### Algorithm Overview

```python
def analyze_phase_correlation(customer_df, customer_voltage_cols, feeder_df, feeder_voltage_cols):
    """
    Analyze correlation between customer phases and feeder phases
    """
    phase_matches = []
    
    # For each customer phase
    for customer_voltage_col in customer_voltage_cols:
        # Test against each feeder phase
        for feeder_voltage_col in feeder_voltage_cols:
            # Align data by timestamp
            aligned_data = align_timestamps(customer_df, feeder_df)
            
            # Calculate correlation and RMSE
            correlation = pearsonr(customer_voltage, feeder_voltage)
            rmse = sqrt(mean_squared_error(customer_voltage, feeder_voltage))
            
            # Calculate combined score
            score = correlation - (normalized_rmse * 0.3)
            
            phase_matches.append({
                'customer_phase': customer_phase,
                'feeder_phase': feeder_phase,
                'correlation': correlation,
                'rmse': rmse,
                'score': score
            })
    
    # Determine best phase assignments
    return determine_phase_assignments(phase_matches)
```

### Phase Assignment Logic

#### Single-Phase Customers:
1. Compare customer's "Phase A" voltage against all feeder phases (A, B, C)
2. Select feeder phase with highest correlation and lowest RMSE
3. Rename customer's "Phase A" column to the correct feeder phase

#### Three-Phase Customers:
1. Compare each customer phase (A, B, C) against all feeder phases
2. For each customer phase, find the best matching feeder phase
3. Rename customer phase columns to match assigned feeder phases

### Statistical Measures

#### Pearson Correlation Coefficient:
- **Range**: -1.0 to +1.0
- **Interpretation**: 
  - 0.7-1.0: Strong positive correlation (likely correct phase)
  - 0.5-0.7: Moderate correlation (probable phase)
  - 0.3-0.5: Weak correlation (uncertain phase)
  - 0.0-0.3: Very weak correlation (likely incorrect phase)

#### Root Mean Square Error (RMSE):
- **Units**: Volts
- **Interpretation**:
  - < 10V: Excellent match
  - 10-20V: Good match
  - 20-50V: Moderate match
  - > 50V: Poor match

#### Combined Score:
```
score = correlation - (normalized_rmse * 0.3)
```
- **Weighting**: Correlation is weighted more heavily than RMSE
- **Purpose**: Balances correlation strength with voltage accuracy

## üéØ Use Cases
